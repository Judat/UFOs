## Summary
### Drawback
One major drawback is that , the search filetr option is case sensitive. If we dont use the exact spellings as mentioned in the list, the results is blank which can be fixed. 

## Recommendations
1: In the filter options, the input can be made more interactive and easy to input.

2: Spelling reccomendation and also date format reccomendation can be added in the filter table to make it more convinient for the reader.
